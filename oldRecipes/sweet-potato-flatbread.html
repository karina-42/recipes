    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 big sweet potato or two small ones</li>
      <li>1 1/2 - 2 cups of flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>(optional) spices for flavoring (garlic powder, cumin, sazon, etc...)</li>
      <li>(optional) 1 teaspoon psyllium husk powder</li>
      <li>almond milk or other liquid</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>     
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Steam sweet potato(es) until soft. In the meantime, sift flour and incorporate baking soda, salt, spices, and psyllium husk.</li>
      <li>When potatoes are done, transfer to a bowl and mash them while slowly adding almond milk until smooth.</li>
      <li>Slowly mix in flour (but save about a half cup) and knead dough in bowl. Add more almond milk if dough is too dry. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Add more flour if it is too sticky. Knead until smooth.</li>
      <li>Let dough rest for about 10 minutes. Prepare your work area. Spread flour on a clean surface and on rolling pin. Heat a frying pan to medium-low heat and spray some olive oil in it. </li>
      <li>Break off a piece of dough, about the size of a mikan. Roll it up and flatten it a bit with your hands, then place on surface over flour and roll flat with the rolling pin.</li>
      <li>Put the flattened dough in the frying pan, heat each side for about 3 minutes. While it's heating prep your next one.</li>
      <li>If freezing, prepare a freezer bag and sheets of wax paper. As the bread is done frying, remove from frying pan and place in the freezer bag in between the wax paper.</li>
      <li>When done, place freezer bag in freezer and then clean up your mess.</li>
