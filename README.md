This is my first project with The Odin Project. I am going to build a basic recipe website.
I will practice relative links by having a main index page which will link to pages with recipes. I will practice all the html I have learned so far: boilerplate, headings, lists, images and links, as well as getting comfortable with git and github. I will also practice project and file organization.
